# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

Group members are working well together, we were able to quickly identify each other strengths & allocate suitable tasks. 
Project is going on as planned, with 2 members focused on coding while the other 2 on presentation & project management.

As we are all busy with work, it was difficult to get together to discuss the project. However, we managed to communicate efficiently on Telegram group chat.

Scrum meetings were all done online. So a lot on time was wasted with poor internet connection, mic, excessive noises etc. It will be more productive if done in person

We have 2 mainly mandarin speakers in the group & a member that does not understand any mandarin, so there were gaps with the communications but we were patient to translate & make sure that everyone was included & heard.
