# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

Group members are working well together, we were able to quickly identify each other strengths & allocate suitable tasks. 
Project is going on as planned, with 2 members focused on coding while the other 2 on presentation & project management.

As we are all busy with work, it was difficult to get together to discuss the project. However, we managed to communicate efficiently on Telegram group chat.

## Sprint Burndown Charts

*In this section include a screenshot of a sprint-burndown chart for each of your completed sprints.*

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
*Add a discussion of what the burndown charts indicate, and how your team might improve their velocity / estimation ability in future sprints.*
